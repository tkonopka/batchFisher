Package: batchFisher
Title: Fast computation of batches of Fisher p-values
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Tomasz Konopka
Maintainer: Tomasz Konopka <t.konopka@qmul.ac.uk>
Description: Fisher p-values are routinely used to compare sets. In situations when many
	     comparisons are performed in a systematic manner, the calculation of p-values
	     can be a bottleneck. The package provides convenience functions that
	     streamline such batch calculations.
